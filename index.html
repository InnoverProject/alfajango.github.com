      <h3>jQuery EasyTabs Plugin</h3>
      <span class='homepage-tagline'>Tabs with(out) style</span>
      <p>After struggling to create custom-designed tabs, messing with numerous CSS classes, overriding all the default styling, and feeling constrained by the required markup, we finally decided to create our own lightweight, flexible jQuery tab plugin.</p>
      <p>Unlike jQuery UI tabs, which style and arrange your tabs and panels for you, this plugin handles only the functionality of the tabs. By leaving the styling and layout up to you, it is much easier to style and arrange your tabs the way you want.</p>

      <p>The Remotipart gem enables AJAX file-upload capability to remote forms in Rails 3 apps by extending the native jquery-ujs functionality.</p>

      <h3>jQuery CSS Emoticons Plugin</h3>
      <span class='homepage-tagline'>Pure CSS emoticons with CSS3</span>
      <p>The CSS Emoticons plugin is a simple jQuery plugin (and
      stylesheet) that allows you to turn any text emoticons on the page
      into cute little smiling faces with pure CSS3 styling (no images
      whatsoever).</p>
      <p>The result is great-looking emoticons that leave the text exactly as
written (so that the text emoticons actually get copied and pasted with
the text if you select a block of text from the page). This uses the
CSS3 properties, transform, border-radius, box-shadow, gradient, and
transition (when supported).</p>

      <p>This is a very simple demo Rails 3.1 with all CRUD (create,
      read, update, delete) functionality in AJAX using the jquery-rails
      gem which bundles jquery-ujs, in combination with the Remotipart
      gem for AJAX file-uploads.</p>

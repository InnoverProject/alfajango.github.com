# WebSockets Demo

This is a demo app to accompany the [WebSockets and Methods for
Real-Time Data
Streaming](http://www.meetup.com/SEM-JS/events/115354852/) talk at the SE Michigan JavaScript users
group (see slides below).

## Background

This app consists of a server and a client. The server happens to be
written in NodeJS, since this was originally created as a demo for a
JavaScript users group after all; but it could have easily been written
in Ruby, Python, or some other language and the lessons would remain the same.

The client is a single HTML webpage, which can be opened directly in
the browser. The page uses the HTML5 WebSocket spec to connect and
stream data to and from the server in real-time.

## Requirements

This app is intended for demonstration purposes, and thus the front-end
uses no 3rd-party WebSockets library, such as Socket.IO; it's just
plain, good old fashioned JavaScript. As a result, this should not be
considered cross-browser compatible. It's been built and tested using
Chrome on Mac OSX.

To run the server, you will need to have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) installed.

## Getting Started

Grab the repo from Github:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/JangoSteve/websockets-demo
{% endhighlight %}

### Demo host

This demo can be run by yourself, or for many people, e.g. over a local
wifi network. For running it yourself or hosting the demo over a
network, you'll need to run the server.

To do this, `cd` into the project's root directory and install:

{% highlight bash %}
cd websockets-demo
npm install
{% endhighlight %}

Once everything is installed, run the server:

{% highlight bash %}
npm start
{% endhighlight %}

### Demo client

Once the server is running, you can connect (and so can anyone else over
the network).

Just open the client page (assuming Chrome is your default
browser; if not, try browsing to the page in your Finder, right click,
and open with Chrome (then again, it may run in Firefox or some other
browser too, who knows)):

{% highlight bash %}
open index.html
{% endhighlight %}

To see the WebSockets in action, try opening the client page a bunch of
times in different tabs:

{% highlight bash %}
open index.html
open index.html
open index.html
open index.html
open index.html
open index.html
open index.html
open index.html
{% endhighlight %}

Optionally, you may also open the client page over the
network, e.g. locally or over wifi, if you have the server
running. Visit http://localhost:8080, or look
up your local network address (e.g. 192.168.1.1) using `ifconfig`
and visit your address on port 8080. 

## Client Modules

Everyone who opens the page will be
connected to the same WebSocket server. The WebSocket server simply
provides the plumbing, via WebSockets, to enable clients to pass and
receive messages to and from other connected clients.

With WebSockets, a message is usually just a string. This app, however,
uses JSON, by simply serializing and deserializing the JSON object as
it's passed between the server and client.

The only
required data in a messaged created by a client module (for the purposes
of this app), is a `type` attribute, which names the type of message
being sent.

For example, the connected event looks like this:

{% highlight js %}
{
  type: 'connection',
  id: ws.id // letting the client know their id
}
{% endhighlight %}

Besides the `type` attribute, the only other attribute which has any
special meaning to the server is the optional `target` attribute. If
included, the server will only send the event to the client with the id
specified by the `target` attribute. If the `target` attribute is not present, the
event will be sent to all connected clients (including the client that
sent it).

For example, the targeted click event looks like this:

{% highlight js %}
{
  type: 'click',
  target: 2 // id of target client to send event
}
{% endhighlight %}

The server forwards these events back to the connected clients (or just
the target client), appending a `sender` attribute to tell the client
who sent the event.

{% highlight js %}
{
  type: 'click',
  target: 2,
  sender: 1
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Event log

A common client-side interaction for this demo is to output to the Event
Log, which is the gray area at the top of the page that informs the
client of captured events from the WebSockets server.

A module can output to the Event Log similar to how you'd output to the
browser's JavaScript debugging console, except via the global `msg` object:

{% highlight js %}
msg.log('Hello there');
{% endhighlight %}

### Core modules

There are three client modules included by default in this app that are
required for the app to function (i.e. the core modules):

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>connected.js
<br />
<a
href="https://github.com/JangoSteve/websockets-demo/blob/master/client_modules/connected.js">
(view source)</a></th>
<td>receives the connected event when the client connects
to the WebSocket server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>connection.js
<br />
<a
href="https://github.com/JangoSteve/websockets-demo/blob/master/client_modules/connection.js">
(view source)</a></th>
<td>receives an event that is sent by the server each
time another client connects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>closed.js
<br />
<a
href="https://github.com/JangoSteve/websockets-demo/blob/master/client_modules/closed.js">
(view source)</a></th>
<td>sends an event to the server when a client disconnects,
and receives the event for the remaining clients.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Included modules

In addition to the required client modules above, two other modules are
included to demonstration what an add-on module would look like and what
they can do:

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="min-width: 75px;">click.js
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/JangoSteve/websockets-demo/blob/master/client_modules/click.js">
(view source)</a></th>
<td>allows clients to click the squares representing other
clients to send them a <code>click</code> type event.
<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/websockets-demo-click-annotated.png" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>follow.js
<br /><a href="https://github.com/JangoSteve/websockets-demo/blob/master/client_modules/follow.js">
(view source)</a></th>
<td>allows clients to click their own square and then move
their mouse around the screen, causing their square to follow their
cursor in real-time on all clients' screens.
<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/websockets-demo-follow.png" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</td></tr>
</table>

### Create your own!

Anyone can create a new module and
include it on their own client page, allowing them to send events of a new
`type` to other users.

The author could then distribute their client module to other users, and
anyone who also include the module in their client page would be able to
receive the events (technically all clients would receive the events
already; they need to include the module in their own page for their
page to do anything as a result of receiving the event).

To create your own module, just add a file to the `client_modules`
folder. For example, let's say you were to have created the click
module. You would first create a new file in `client_modules` called
`click.js`.

In that file, we need to do three things:

1) Register the module with the client:

{% highlight js %}
msg.install("click.js", "#");
{% endhighlight %}

The first argument above is the name of the module. The second argument is an
optional URL to link to the homepage for your module.

2) Send our event payload to the server. In this case, we
only want to send it when the client clicks a square that is not their
own.

{% highlight js %}
$(document).delegate('.client[data-id]', 'click', function (e) {
  var target = $(this).data('id'),
      message = JSON.stringify({type: 'click', target: target});
  if (target !== connection.id) { // don't send clicks to ourselves
    connection.send(message);
    msg.log('Click sent to client ' + target + '.');
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

3) And finally, we need to define how the client reacts when our payload is
received from the server.

We do this by defining a function on the
global `msg` object, whose name matches the `type` attribute from our
payload (by convention, this should match the name of your module).

{% highlight js %}
msg.click = function(data) {
  msg.log('Click received from client ' + data.sender + '.');
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's it, a working module!
